        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure if you are using frozen fish that it is completely thawed before brining. Remove pin bones with tweezers.</li>
            <li>Combine brine ingredients until the sugar is dissolved, and place into a large ziplock baggie or large covered container. Place your cleaned, thawed salmon into the brine, and refrigerate for 16 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the salmon from the liquid, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels. Let sit out in a rack in the fridge, uncovered, for 2-4 hours for the pellicle to form. DO NOT SKIP THAT STEP.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Seasoning</h3>
                <p>Season the salmon with the togarashi.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Smoking</h3>
                <p>Turn your smoker to smoke to get the fire started, and place the salmon on a cooking rack that's been sprayed liberally with cooking spray</p>
                <p>Place the rack on the smoker, and close the lid.</p>
                <p>Smoke for 4 hours, and don't let them smoker get above 180° or fall under 130°.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serve</h3>
                <p>Remove from the grill and serve warm with crackers, or let it cool to room temp and then wrap tightly and keep in the fridge for up to a week. You can also vacuum seal and freeze.</p>
            </li>
